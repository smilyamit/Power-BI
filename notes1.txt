# In Dashboard of Power BI we have 3 parts
1) Upper Ribbon (FIle, Home, Insert, modelling, View, Format, Data/Drill)
2) White Dashboard (After loading any file in dashboard , here u can manipulate & visualize : report, data, model)
3) Left Ribbon (Filters, Visualizations, Fields)

# Power Query Editor(for data transfoemation)
* It is a self service ETL tool for Power BI
Note : after loading data (let say excels file of 3 sheet) u will get option of load, transform data, cancel
       click on transform to get utilization of power query tool
* here in power query editor we have history as applied steps, where we can undo our steps

1)where u can delete the unnecessary row
2) Add first row as your header of columns, there is one option in header ribbon of power query editor
3) In Power query editor u will also have history at right (as applied steps) where u can undo your previous task

# Different Visualization segment for different types of data
* Histogram is good for visualization of -->distributed data (For eg distr. of each quality of mango in your garden)
* Trend of your data is best shown -->line chart
* composition analysis of data ---> (Donout, pie chart) for small variety
* * composition analysis of data ---> (stack bar chart) for large variety

* Relation--> scatter plot
* Comparision of data ---> Bar Graph
*Flat files eg: csv, excel, pdf, text etc

# In dashboard of Power BI we have Transform data table(ie Power Query editor) where we will do table editings
#In dashboard (report, data, model)
* In model we have --> dimension/Refrence table (customer id, product name) and fact table (eg sales, qty)
* In power Bi we have many relations one to many, many to many , many to one
* Before connecting reference table to fact table we cannot create slicer
